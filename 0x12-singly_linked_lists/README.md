# C - Singly linked lists
In this lesson, we are dealing with linked lists.

A linked list is a set of dynamically allocated nodes, arranged in such a way that each node contains one value and one pointer. The pointer always points to the next member of the list. If the pointer is NULL, then it is the last node in the list.

## Objectives
* When and why using linked lists vs arrays
* How to build and use linked lists

### Tasks
* Printing all elements in a linked list
* Printing the number of elements in a linked list
* Add a node at the beginning of a list
* Add a node at the end of a node
* Free a linked list
* Printing 'You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n' before the main function is executed.
* Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
