# C - Bit manipulation
This project contains C source code files on bit manipulation using the binary operators.

## Objectives
* Understanding bits and bytes
* Bitwise operators
* Bit manipulation
* Bit conversions

## How to run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine

* You can http or ssh

2. Change directory to this directory in you machine

`cd 0x14-bit_manipulation`

3. Executing - for that you should have in maind that each file is kind of an individual assignment. So, each file is executed using the follwing command

`gcc file_name.c -o program`

4. Running - the compiled code using the syntax:

`./program`

## Important
These steps may not be necessary but who knows who might need them
