# C Programming 
## Low Level Programming
In this journey, C programming language is the target. A whole new exprience awaits!

## Introducing C
C is an imperative(procedural)language. Invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. C is a decendant of the **B** programming language, created by **Ken Thompson** in the late 1960s.
C has a remarkable impact in the field of computer and has served as the foundation for many other programming languages like C++ and C#.
