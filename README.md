	* *Comments*: in programming, a comment is a piece of text that is added to the source code of a program or script for the purpose of providing human-readable explanations, notes, or documentation about the code. Comments are ignored by the compiler or interpreter and have no impact on the execution of the program. Their primary purpose is to make the code more understandable to developers and maintainers.
