# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
In this session, we are hardening the foundation. Pointers, arrays and string are crucial in C.

## Objectives
* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

Deeper dive indeed with pointers.
