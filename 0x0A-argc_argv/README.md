# C - argc, argv
This topic makes me feel powerful! I know right... The happiness of your first results.
**argc :** is a count of the arguments supplied to the program.
**argv :** is an array of pointers to the strings which are those arguments—its type is (almost) ‘array of pointer to char’.

These arguments are passed to the program by the host system's command line interpreter or job control language

## Objectives
* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use *__attribute__((unused)) or (void)* (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ztpf/2020?topic=warnings-unused-variables-functions) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
