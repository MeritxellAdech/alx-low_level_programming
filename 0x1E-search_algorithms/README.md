# C - Search Algorithms
This directory contains the code and documentation for the `Search Algorithm` project.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to implement [Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm) for information retrival from a particular data structure.

## Requirements
* Install `gcc`
* Fork this repository
* Clone the project from your Github
* `cd 0x1E-search_algorithms`

## Usage
Once the setup is done, you have to run the files individually.

* Create an entry point  or `main.c` file with a test case for testing.
* Create an executable `gcc main.c filename.c -o exec`
* Run the executable `./exec`

### Note
You can only execute `C` files.
